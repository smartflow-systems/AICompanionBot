## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with premium SFS brand colors (black #000000, dark brown #3E2723, gold #FFD700) featuring glass card effects, smooth animations, and professional typography
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and building

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (configured in drizzle.config.ts)
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Development Setup**: Hot reloading with Vite middleware integration

### Key Components

#### Database Schema (Drizzle ORM)
- **Users**: Basic user authentication structure
- **Bots**: Bot entities with configuration, stats, and activity tracking
- **Posts**: Social media posts with engagement metrics
- **Activities**: Bot activity logging system
- **Comments**: Post comments with bot/user attribution

#### Bot System
- **Bot Types**: Content creator, engagement, follower, and analytics bots
- **Configuration**: Customizable activity levels, keywords, schedules, and rate limiting
- **Statistics Tracking**: Performance metrics including engagement rates and interaction counts
- **Real-time Simulation**: Automated bot behavior simulation

#### UI Architecture
- **Dashboard Layout**: Premium sidebar navigation with hero section and tabbed content organization
- **Component Structure**: Glass card components with enhanced bot cards, activity feeds, and Chart.js analytics
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts and improved accessibility
- **Theme System**: SFS premium brand colors with CSS custom properties and animation utilities
- **Monetization**: Integrated freemium model with upgrade modals and feature limitations

### Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the dashboard to create and configure bots
2. **API Communication**: Frontend communicates with Express backend via REST API
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles database queries and mutations
4. **Real-time Updates**: TanStack Query provides optimistic updates and cache management
5. **Bot Simulation**: Backend simulates bot activities and updates statistics
6. **Feed Generation**: Social feed displays simulated posts and interactions

### External Dependencies

#### Core Framework Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, React DOM, React Hook Form
- **UI Libraries**: Radix UI components, Lucide React icons
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon Database serverless client
- **Utilities**: date-fns for date formatting, zod for schema validation

#### Development Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite, esbuild for production builds
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across frontend and backend
- **Development Experience**: Hot reloading, error overlays, Replit integration

### Deployment Strategy

#### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express API integration
- **Hot Reloading**: Vite middleware handles frontend updates
- **Database**: Neon Database for development and production
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection

#### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized React bundle to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild compiles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Assets**: Vite handles asset optimization and fingerprinting
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations

#### Architecture Decisions

**Database Choice**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM was chosen for its type safety, schema management, and compatibility with serverless deployments. Neon Database provides a managed PostgreSQL solution that works well in cloud environments.

**State Management**: TanStack Query handles server state rather than client state managers like Redux, reducing complexity and providing built-in caching, background updates, and optimistic updates.

**UI Framework**: shadcn/ui provides high-quality, customizable components built on Radix UI primitives, offering accessibility and flexibility while maintaining design consistency.

**Monorepo Structure**: The codebase uses a shared folder for types and schemas, allowing type safety between frontend and backend while maintaining separation of concerns.

**Development Experience**: The setup prioritizes developer experience with hot reloading, TypeScript throughout, and integrated error handling for rapid iteration.
